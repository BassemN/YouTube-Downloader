# YouTube Downloader

This project was inspired by a very popular [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) python package:

Yes, there are multiple PHP-based youtube downloaders on the Internet, but all of them haven't been updated in years or they depend on youtube-dl.

This script does not depend on anything other than cURL. No Javascript interpreters, no calls to shell... nothing but pure PHP.
